# Proteus - Middleman

## About Proteus

[Proteus](http://github.com/thoughtbot/proteus) is a collection of useful
starter kits to help you prototype faster. It follows the
[thoughtbot styleguide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides) and includes our
favorite front end tools.

## About Middleman

Middleman is a static site generator built in Ruby. This makes it a great fit
for projects that may end up as a Ruby on Rails app. Its minimalistic structure
makes it very easy to work with, and includes support for deploying to Github
Pages.

  Simple template markup
* [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org):
  Write javascript with simpler syntax
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com):
  CSS with superpowers
* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io):

* [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io):

* [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io):

* [Middleman Live Reload](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-livereload):
  Reloads the page when files change
* [Middleman Deploy](https://github.com/karlfreeman/middleman-deploy):

We also recommend [Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/) for prepackaged interface patterns.
